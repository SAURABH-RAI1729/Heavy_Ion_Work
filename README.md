# Heavy_Ion_Work
A repository reproducing some of the results for pT fluctuations in pp collisions from "Event-by-event mean pT fluctuations in pp and Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC"-ALICE arXiv:1407.5530v2 [nucl-ex] and "Skewness and kurtosis of mean transverse momentum fluctuations at the LHC energies"-ALICE arXiv:2308.16217v2 [nucl-ex].
As an exercise, results from "Charged-particle distributions in âˆšs = 13 TeV pp interactions measured with the ATLAS detector at the LHC"-ATLAS arXiv:1602.01633v2 [hep-ex] were also reproduced.
This work was later used as a foundation for a heavy-ion analysis.
